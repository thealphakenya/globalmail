    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code

      # Optional: Set up Node.js if your project requires it (remove if not needed)

      # Step 2: Install dependencies using Yarn
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install

      # Step 3: Start the app using Yarn (assuming "start" script runs lite-server)
      - name: Start the application
        run: yarn start &  # The `&` runs it in the background, so the next step can proceed.

      # Step 4: Deploy the built files to GitHub Pages

        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # GitHub automatically provides this token
